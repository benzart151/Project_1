	My name is Ben Beller, Louis R Beller was my father, and I miss my him very much. But I know he’s in a better place.Those of you that know me know that he had dementia, and at the end he wasn’t able to communicate at all. He couldn’t even enjoy his last favorite activity, eating, he had to be fed through a tube. Even though I miss him it was time for him to move on. He had a long and full life that certainly wasn’t without challenges, but none the less he enjoyed his life and was there for a lot of people along the way.
